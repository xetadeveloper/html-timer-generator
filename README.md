# HTML Timer/Countdown Generator
A small application that generates html for timers, which you can embed in your code.

### Notes
* You can use the current date for the timer to start counting down from or you can use a a set date.
* You can set the timer to run to a particular date or for a set amount of time ranging from days to seconds.

## Instructions
1. Set your options using the UI
2. Click "Generate code"
3. Copy generated code and use anywhere!😁👌 

## Styling
To change the styling of the timer, you'll have to edit the css style tag in the head, but not the HTML specifically so that the script still has access to the elements that it needs.
